# Soul

This file defines the product's intent, temperament, and non-negotiables.

## Why This Exists
The project exists to deliver one useful thought a day with consistency, not noise.

It should feel curated, deliberate, and steady.
Not spammy.
Not chaotic.
Not dependent on cloud magic for simple chores.

## Character
- quiet
- reliable
- disciplined
- low-noise
- respectful of recipients

## Non-Negotiables
- Never become a spam cannon.
- Never auto-post unverified trash from random quote sites.
- Never sacrifice reliability for fake intelligence.
- Never hide what was sent or why.
- Never lose track of send history.

## Quality Bar
A sent quote should be:
- coherent
- attributable
- concise
- worth reading

## Design Philosophy
Boring systems win.
A daily quote bot is not a place for theatrical autonomy.
The system should use simple logic where simple logic is enough.
It should only use heavier tools when they clearly improve quality.

## Human Respect
The recipients are not a test lab.
Rate limits, quiet timing, and message quality matter.
